# Coffee Sales Analysis Project
Sales 2019-2022

This is my second project as I continue applying what I've learned from my self-study in Microsoft Excel and data analytics.

## Project Overview
This Coffee Sales Analysis Project aims to explore, analyze, understand trends and patterns in coffee sales across different coffee types, roast levels, sizes, country, and year (2019-2022). By analyzing sales data, the project identifies sales over time,  which types of coffee are most popular, observes seasonal trends, and explores variations in customer preferences. The findings from this project can be used to inform business strategies, guide marketing efforts, and support product development. The analysis provides insights into the coffee market and offers recommendations for optimizing sales and targeting key customer segments.
